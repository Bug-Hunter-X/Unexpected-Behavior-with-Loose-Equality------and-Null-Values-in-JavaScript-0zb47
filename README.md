This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) and null values. The `bug.js` file contains code that exhibits the issue. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  The problem arises from the fact that loose equality does type coercion, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This example specifically shows how to handle potential null values in the calculation.
